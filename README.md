<small> An introduction to Javascript for those who have been introduced to HTML, CSS (, and perhaps toyed with a bit of jQuery )</small>

Javascript is a programming language commonly used in web browsers to add dynamic and interactive features to web pages. Ever wondered how the webpage knew you hadn't entered a correct email address before you submitted the form? Javascript. Form validation is just one example of javascript can do, you can create all sorts of apps and games using the language.
