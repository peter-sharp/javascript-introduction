# javascript-introduction
An introduction to Javascript for those who have been introduced to HTML, CSS (, and perhaps toyed with a bit of jQuery )

Javascript is a programming language commonly used in web browsers to add dynamic and interactive features to web pages. Ever wondered how the webpage knew you hadn't entered a correct email address before you submitted the form? Javascript. Form validation is just one example of javascript can do, you can create all sorts of [apps](todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/) and games using the language.

###Hello world
A "hello world" program shows the basic syntax ( computer language grammar ) needed for a working computer program.
in javascript this is:
``` alert('Hello, world!'); ```
